# *z*Hunter

*z*Hunter is a Graphical User Interface (GUI) tool to visualize and perform basic manipulation of 1D and 2D astronomical spectra.
It is originally developped to help find (hunt for) the redshift *z* of transient sources observed spectroscopically, hence its name.
It uses [`Python 3.8`](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-383/) and is based on the [`pyqtgraph`](https://pyqtgraph.readthedocs.io/en/latest/introduction.html) library for speed (as opposed to the more commonly used [`matplotlib`](https://matplotlib.org/)).
